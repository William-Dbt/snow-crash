# In our home we can see two files, a binary named 'level09' and one named 'token' that contains a string.
# With strings and tests we can watch that the binary modify a string char by char with the char's position in the string
# Example:

String: a a a
		0 1 2

Result: a   b   c
		a+0 a+1 a+2

# Once we understand this, let's check the token file
# We can see a string with extended ascii chars
# Let's create a program in C that will reverse the behavior of the binary
# You can see the code in the file reverse.c
# Get the file token with scp

scp -P 4242 level09@IP:~/token destination_folder

# Compile the program and give the token file in parameters

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror reverse.c
./a.out destination_folder/token

# We can't copy/paste the content of token file because of extended ascci chars
# Let's connect to flag09

su flag09
f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

# Execute getflag
