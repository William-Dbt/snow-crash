# Got two files in home repository: level10 program and token files
# We supposed that we have to open token with level10
# level10 takes two params: file and host

level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10
./level10 file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it

# We can understand that we have to send the file token to a server which reads files
# Thanks to mini_serv exam at 42 and ft_irc we can create a server that will read in fds

=> /level10/resources/server.c

# The problem is that we can't open ~/token due to file's access rights
# Thanks to strings, we can see that level10 use the function access and, in the manual of access
# It says that a security hole exists:
# Warning:  Using  access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actu-
#           ally doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the  short  time
#           interval  between  checking and opening the file to manipulate it.
# Let's exploit this
#
# Create a file that we have access (/tmp/root here)
# Create a script that will create a symlink of /tmp/root named symlink (/tmp/symlink)
# remove it and create another symlink of ~/token named symlink (/tmp/symlink)
# The script will loop on these commands indefinitely

=> /level10/resources/while_symlink.sh

# Create a second script that will execute the binary level10 and call /tmp/symlink as file and 0.0.0.0 as host

=> /level10/resources/while_level10.sh

# You can find a 'copy_files.sh' in the resources folder to copy these files in the /tmp folder of the vm
# Let's start all of this creapy machine together

/level10/resources/copy_files.sh
# Don't forget to change the IP of the VM to scp files

# Thanks to ssh and 3 terminal, first compile the server.c with gcc

## => Terminal 1
gcc server.c
./a.out
# It's a server, it will listen for all incomming connections on 0.0.0.0

# start all the scripts together and watch carefully for the terminal where the server is op

## => Terminal 2
/tmp/while_symlink.sh
